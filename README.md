## - Why use SlicePathURL?

Examples:

Sometimes, Nuclei may fail to identify a vulnerability in the root domain, for example, in https://example.com/. However, it is possible that vulnerabilities may exist in paths beyond the root domain, such as in https://example.com/path_one/. 

Below is a real example that was found:

```bash
echo "https://subdomain.example.com/"|nuclei -tags rce

[INF] No results found. Better luck next time!
```

```bash
echo "https://subdomain.example.com/extranet/"|nuclei -tags rce

[2023-01-01 23:54:42] [CVE-2017-5638] [http] [critical] https://subdomain.example.com/extranet/
```
