</p>

<h3 align="center">SlicePathURL slices a URL into directory levels to complement tools like Nuclei in searching for vulnerabilities in directories beyond the root of the URL.</h3>


## - Installation & Requirements:

```bash
> go install github.com/erickfernandox/slicepathurl@latest
```
OR
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/erickfernandox/slicepathurl.git
> cd slicepathurl
> go build slicepathurl.go
> chmod +x slicepathurl
> ./slicepathurl -h
```
<br>

## - Why use SlicePathURL?

Examples:

Sometimes, Nuclei may fail to identify a vulnerability in the root domain, for example, in https://example.com/. However, it is possible that vulnerabilities may exist in paths beyond the root domain, such as in https://example.com/path_one/. 

Below is a real example that was found:

```bash
echo "https://subdomain.example.com/"|nuclei -tags rce

[INF] No results found. Better luck next time!
```

```bash
echo "https://subdomain.example.com/extranet/"|nuclei -tags rce

[2023-01-01 23:54:42] [CVE-2017-5638] [http] [critical] https://subdomain.example.com/extranet/
```

An RCE vulnerability, CVE-2017-5638, was discovered in Apache Struts in an application hosted at https://example.com/extranet/, but it was not found in the root directory of https://example.com/.


## - How does SlicePathURL work?


```bash

subfinder -d example.com | gauplus | slicepathurl -l 2 > urls_all_paths_level2.txt
cat urs_all_paths_level2.txt | nuclei -tags crlf,rce,redirect

```
